Description:
=============
For easier window resizing I added wide borders.
For easier button clicking I added big buttons (Windows-like).

I try to tackle the problem of needing a very precise mouse aiming to handle windows.

Howto install:
==============

   1. Download from github (zip file)
   2. Extract content into 
      - ~/.local/share/themes
         - for current user only
      - /usr/share/themes
         - for all users
   3. Select Theme from Window Manager dialog

Screenshots
===========
There are various variations of this Theme
